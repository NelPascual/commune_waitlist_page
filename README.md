# Challenge Commune Waitlist Page! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Nelson Pascual, I am a novice in what refers to web development, I am learning in a self-taught way.

This is the first challenge I do, and I thank Codewell for providing this kind of free material to be able to practice the designs.

I tried to elaborate the designs according to the three proposed by the platform, as similar as possible.

For the adaptive designs I relied a little on Flexbox and Grid, I made use of the custom properties for color management.

I hope to receive your feedback to improve every day.

Have a great day.
